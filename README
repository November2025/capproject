Welcome to my cat memory game! This game gives you 2 minutes to match as many cards as you can. This is a fun game where you can enjoy seeing cats, excersizing your brain and just get away from stress for a few minutes!!!
Have fun and enjoy!!
My game utilizes arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed. For example, my memory game has a grid of cards, and an array holds the values or images for each card.
The game also analyzes data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps to display information about it. For example, it shows the number of matches found or the number of moves made so far on the screen.
Update the display to show which cards are currently face-up
