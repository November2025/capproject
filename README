Welcome to my cat memory game! This game gives you 2 minutes to match as many cards as you can. This is a fun game where you can enjoy seeing cats, excersizing your brain and just get away from stress for a few minutes!!!
Have fun and enjoy!!
My game utilizes arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed. For example, my memory game has a grid of cards, and an array holds the values or images for each card.
