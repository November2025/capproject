Welcome to my cat memory game! This game gives you 2 minutes to match as many cards as you can. This is a fun game where you can enjoy seeing cats, excersizing your brain and just get away from stress for a few minutes!!!
Have fun and enjoy!!
My game utilizes arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed. For example, my memory game has a grid of cards, and an array holds the values or images for each card.
The game also analyzes data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps to display information about it. For example, it shows the number of matches found or the number of moves made so far on the screen.
It also updates the display to show which cards are currently face-up. 
My game also retrieves data from a third-party API and uses it to display the pictures of the cats on the cards.
The API used for this was: https://api.thecatapi.com.
My game also utilizes the function to calculate and display data based on an external factor. For example, the timmer is running and you only have 2 minutes to get as many matches as possible.  
To run and play my game please run it from the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
